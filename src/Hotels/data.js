    description: "The hotel completed a renovation in March 2015, so everything feels up-to-date. Wallpaper and curtains are also in gray tones, but the carpets are patterned with dark blue, and the white linens are topped with navy throw pillows. Desks are large enough to spread out and get some real work done, and even the more basic Deluxe rooms have almost 500 square feet of space.",

    name: "JW Marriott",
    description: "An ovular glass skyscraper jutting 33 stories into air, the JW Marriott Nashville is hard to miss. This is the city’s only true luxury hotel—although more are in the works—and it's one of the city’s most recognizable buildings. You can't help but crane your neck upward, jaw open. Inside, the décor is sleek, and crisp, and it oozes fanciness.",

    name: "Le Bristol",
    description: "Spread out between the main building and the Matignon wing, the 190 rooms and suites are airy and spacious, with views of the grand avenue or a flower-filled courtyard. The sedate style comes courtesy of Louis XV- and Louis XVI-era furnishings, original paintings, antique mirrors, and designer fabrics, many in the hotel's signature pink and green hues.",

    name: "Umaid Bhawan Palace",
    description: "The largest, most magnificent, most dramatic, most otherworldly palace in the land. The spectacle of it, the Art Deco design, the peacocks strutting on the lawn. The Maharaja and his family still live here in what was once his family home. This is hotel as extraordinary stage set, from another time, like Gatsby ate Indian space dust and the go-go girls danced till dawn. A golden sandstone palace on the top of Chittar Hill, where the first thing you experience is the royal welcome: ceremonial drums, red carpet, rose petals, and a glass of Champagne under the 105-foot cupola.",

    name: "Sir Albert Hotel",
    description: "Occupying an 1895 red-brick factory in Amsterdam’s stylish and formerly working-class De Pijp neighborhood, this member of Marriott’s Design Hotels continues to sparkle like the diamonds it once produced. Unlike many post-industrial revamps, there’s very little sign of the original factory here—and that’s a good thing. Interior designers Alon Baranowitz and Irene Kronenberg have upped the warmth factor with a palette that skews toward tobacco browns and burnt siennas, with textures like leather and cowhide and statement pieces from Dutch furniture-design superstars like Piet Hein Eek and Joy van Erven.",
